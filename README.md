Helping interns find community faster

# Product Vision Statement

Helping interns build meaningful social connections during their internships by providing a centralized platform to discover peers, coordinate meetups, and share local knowledge, all in one place.

Every summer, thousands of students relocate to unfamiliar cities for internships, often knowing very few people. While internships provide valuable professional experience, they can also be socially isolating and logistically challenging. InternBuddy addresses this by reducing the friction of meeting new people and navigating a new environment.


## Description

InternBuddy is a mobile-first web application designed to connect students who are interning in the same city, company, or time period. Instead of relying on scattered platforms like LinkedIn, spreadsheets, or group chats, InternBuddy offers a unified and student-focused experience.

Key features include:

User Profiles – Students create profiles with school, company, role, city, internship dates, and interests

Intern Discovery – Find other interns based on shared attributes such as company, city, or overlapping dates

Group Communities – Join city-based or company-based groups to interact with peers

Meetup Coordination – Create and browse casual meetups like coffee chats, group dinners, or weekend activities

Knowledge Sharing – Share tips on housing, commuting, and intern-specific events

InternBuddy is designed to lower the barrier to social interaction, especially for users who may feel hesitant initiating connections in unfamiliar environments.

## Example User Flow

    1. User registers and creates a profile with internship details
    2. User browses interns in the same city or company
    3. User joins a group (e.g., “NYC Interns” or “Google Interns”)
    4. User discovers or creates a meetup event
    5. User connects with peers and attends meetups
